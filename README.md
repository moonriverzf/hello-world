# hello-world
it's a new start
Today I begin to try github for the frist time. Having known it for a long time, but have never a chance to try, fro seemingly no such a valuable project to be worked by it. Since now I begin to cooperate with colleague and student together on some complicated projects. I think it's valable to begin now, today.
